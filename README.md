# tidytuesday
This repo contains analysis on various data from [TidyTuesday's](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) weekly project. 
Many of the analyses are inspired by analyses done by [David Robinson](https://github.com/dgrtwo/data-screencasts), and [Julia Silge](www.juliasilge.com).
Both are very frequent contributors to TidyTuesday's analysis and have been very helpful in providing steps, careful thought processes on doing good statistical analysis.
You can also follow #tidytuesday on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23tidytuesday&src=typed_query) for more amazing analyses done by people.
